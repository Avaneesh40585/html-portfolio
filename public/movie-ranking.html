    Really cool sci-fi movie which gave a good look of what black hole would be before the real data
 </p>
<h3>2) The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>
    Absolutely stunning action from heath ledger (Joker) the best acting ive seen so far in any of the movies ive watched
</p>
<h3>3) Oppenheimer</h3>

    Beautiful biopic. "Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man". For this he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity.
